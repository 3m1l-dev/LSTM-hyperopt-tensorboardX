# Optimising a Recurrent Neural Network with hyperopt and tensorboardX

<img align="right" src="tensorboardXample.png" width=350 height=400/>

In this project I worked on tuning a recurrent neural networks hyper parameters using the popular optimisation package Hyperopt.

The data used was from the [Kaggle Quora Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification)
